# First non-repeating character

Write a function named firstNonRepeatingLetter that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.

For example:
- `"a"` -> `"a"`
- `"aa"` -> `""` 
- `"stress"` -> `"t"`, since the letter t only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.
- `"moonmen"` -> `"e"` 

Upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same character, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter. For example, the input 'sTreSS' should return 'T'.
